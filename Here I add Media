           <h4> Review:</h4>
           <p> Hi Nanna, a much-anticipated film of the season, directed by Shouryuv and featuring Nani and Mrunal Thakur, lives up to
            expectations, offering a cinematic experience rich in emotional depth. The 155-minute runtime expertly explores the
            nuances of love, marriage, and parenthood, maintaining engagement and feeding the soul.</p>
           <p> The performances by Nani, Mrunal Thakur, and Kiara Khanna bring the heartwarming family drama to life. Their portrayal
            of vulnerabilities and the essence of the father-daughter bond is commendable. Nani's post-Dasara transformation adds a
            fresh touch to his character, while Mrunal displays versatility with panache. The chemistry between the lead actors is
            palpable, making their on-screen moments a delight. Their characters are intricately layered and thoroughly explored.
            Whether stepping into the shoes of a photographer, depicting the desperation of a father, or conveying the longing of a
            lover, Nani strikes all the right chords, and Mrunal beautifully compliments him.</p>
           <p> Kiara Khanna, portraying Mahi, steals hearts with a brilliant performance, becoming the cutest and most beautiful aspect
            of the movie. Even Pluto, the pet dog, delivers an impressive performance, becoming an integral part of the plot. The
            film has plenty of moments that moist the eyes of the audience.</p>
            <p>The ensemble cast, including Shruti Haasan, Nassar, Priyadarshi, Angad Bedi, Jayaram, and Hemayat Rahman, contributes
            effectively to the film's beauty. Shruti and Nani shake a leg in the peppy song ‘The Party Anthem Odiyamma’ during an
            episode in Goa. And it acts as a swift break from the poetic narrative showcased in the film.</p>
           <p> Kushi fame Hesham Abdul Wahab's musical brilliance, Sanu John Varghese's cinematography, and Praveen Anthony’s editing
            enhance the emotional depth of the narrative, turning it into a tastefully crafted saga with top-notch production
            values. Despite some predictability and slow-paced narrative, all the crafts came together to create an engaging
            cinematic experience.</p>
           <p> While the film maintains engagement throughout, minor lags occasionally surface, providing the lead characters with
            ample time to establish and showcase their emotions. Hi Nanna transcends being just a movie; it's a journey through
            love, resilience, and the delicate threads that bind a family together. Shouryuv, Nani, Mrunal, and the entire cast have
            created a beautiful film that resonates with the audience, making the film a must-watch for those seeking a blend of
            heart and soul in cinema.</p>
